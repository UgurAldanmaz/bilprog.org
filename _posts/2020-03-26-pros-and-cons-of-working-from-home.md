No commuting, working in pajamas... Are they the real benefits of remote working?

I have been working from home for 3 years. I am going to explain the subjects that important which you should take care.

# Health
You will have time to prepare and eat healthy foods. But also it is easy to being lazy. You may end up with eating junk foods. You should beware and avoid the fast-food.

Sitting front of the computer whole day is obviously unhealthy. You will need do exercise. Again, do not become lazy! Do your exercise or take for a walk at least 30 minutes every day.

# Socializing
As a human, you already need to socialize. But if you are working from home, socializing becomes vitally important. After a work day, you need to go out and have some fun. You may easily become lazy while working from home and you may postpone socializing. Do not be lazy, socialize!

# Learning new things
You can learn new things from the people around you in the office. Unfortunately, you will be alone and not have this chance. But you will have more time to learn new things and to work on your side-projects.

# Networking
I met most of my friends while working in an office. They know how I am working. They sometimes offer me a new job. After starting working from home, it has become harder to make friends from work. But you still have a chance to go to the developer events and networking there!

# Pros and Cons
There is no pros and cons. **Balance** is everything. Do not become lazy and try to take advantage of working from home!
