# How have I reduced the noice in my head

These days everyone has a list that contains bunch of goals to achive. These lists make noise in our heads. Here is how I've reduced the noice.

I have a lot of things to learn as a software developer. Everyday is a day of a new technology arises.
I was desperate with my noisy wish list. I need to learn NoSQL, what is Blockchain, improve your English skills, contribute to an open source project and so on.

First of all, I jotted down all of them onto a paper then tried to clarify; what, why, when, and how.
Honestly I eliminated a lot of things that I do not need them at length. For example, machine learning.

----- give an example for above sentence (what, why, xxx)

After that I picked up a few that I really need to do:

* Improve English skills
* Learn Python and NoSQL
* Build an application
* Launch a blog

I calculated my free time to do them and allocated 3 or 4 hours for every day. It should be flexible. You have a life, and you need to live it! If you want to go to a concert tonight, just go for it. You can work tomorrow but you may not have a chance to go that concert. But promise yourself, you will catch the missing days.

Then I tried to make a list that contains related tasks. After looking to my list I suddenly realized that I can achive one goal by achiving another one. For example, I can improve my listening and reading skills by taking a Python course then I can build an application by learning Python. Furthermore, I can improve my writing skills by writing about what I learned on Pyhton!

Then I started to stick to it and do not bother myself for lost days. Because this list already gives me a clear vision and I can tolarete if I cannot follow the plan.

Then I worked day by day. Whenever I feel that there is something heavy and I cannot follow the plan because of that, I revised my list.
This list should be flexible as well as adapted to your daily situation.

Here is my list for you.
