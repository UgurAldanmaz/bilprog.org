# How have I reduced the noice in my head

These days everyone has a list that contains bunch of goals to achive. These lists make noice in our heads. Here is how have I reduced the noice.

I have a lot of things to learn as a software developer. Everyday is a day that a new technology arises.
I was desperate with my noicy wish list. I need to learn NoSQL, what is Blockchain, improve your English, contribute to an open source project and so on.

First of all, I jot down all of them onto a paper then tried to clarify; what, why, when, and how.
Honestly I eliminated a lot of things that I do not need them for a long time. For example, learn machine learning.

----- give an example for above sentence (what, why, xxx)

After that I picked up a few that I really need to do.

----- give their titles (learn english, open source, xxx).

I calculated my free time to do them and allocated 4 hours for every day. It should be filexible. you have a life, and you need to live it! If you want to go to a concert tonight, just go for it. you can work tomorrow but you cannot go that concert at any time.

Then tried to make a list that contains related tasks. For example, I can learn Python by doing a pet project. So Learning Ptyhon and working on my pet project can be on the same day and I can work on it for 2 hours.

----- give a sample list.

Then start to stick to it and do not bother myself for lost days. Because this list already gives me a clear vision and I can tolarete if I cannot follow the plan.

Then I worked day by day. Whenever I feel that there is something heavy and I cannot follow the plan because of that, I revised my list.
This list should be flexible as well as adapted to your daily situation.

Here is my list for you.
